For a specific case, see default gateway.</li></ul>Gateways, also called protocol converters, can operate at any network layer. The activities of a gateway are more complex than that of the router or switch as it communicates using more than one protocol.<br>Both the computers of Internet users and the computers that serve pages to users are host nodes, while the nodes that connect the networks in between are gateways. For example, the computers that control traffic between company networks or the computers used by internet service providers (ISPs) to connect users to the internet are gateway nodes.<br>In the network for an enterprise, a computer server acting as a gateway node is often also acting as a proxy server and a firewall server. A gateway is often associated with both a router, which knows where to direct a given packet of data that arrives at the gateway, and a switch, which furnishes the actual path in and out of the gateway for a given packet.<br>On an IP network, clients should automatically send IP packets with a destination outside a given subnet mask to a network gateway. A subnet mask defines the IP range of a private network. For example, if a private network has a base IP address of 192.168.0.0 and has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, then any data going to an IP address outside of 192.168.0.X will be sent to that network's gateway.

        "PBR":       "Policy-Based Routing|In computer networking, policy-based routing (PBR) is a technique used to make routing decisions based on policies set by the network administrator.<br>When a router receives a packet it normally decides where to forward it based on the destination address in the packet, which is then used to look up an entry in a routing table. However, in some cases, there may be a need to forward the packet based on other criteria. For example, a network administrator might want to forward a packet based on the source address, not the destination address. This should not be confused with source routing.<br>Policy-based routing may also be based on the size of the packet, the protocol of the payload, or other information available in a packet header or payload. This permits routing of packets originating from different sources to different networks even when the destinations are the same and can be useful when interconnecting several private networks.<br>In the Cisco IOS, PBR is implemented using route maps.

Particular aspects of the service - scope, quality, responsibilities - are agreed between the service provider and the service user. A common feature of an SLA is a contracted delivery time (of the service or performance). As an example, Internet service providers and telephone companies will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in terms of mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair or mean time to recovery (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; throughput; jitter; or similar measurable details.",

SaaS is becoming an increasingly prevalent delivery model as underlying technologies that support Web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) mature and new developmental approaches, such as Ajax, become popular. Meanwhile, broadband service has become increasingly available to support user access from more areas around the world.<br>SaaS is closely related to the ASP (application service provider) and on demand computing software delivery models. IDC identifies two slightly different delivery models for SaaS. The hosted application management (hosted AM) model is similar to ASP: a provider hosts commercially available software for customers and delivers it over the Web. In the software on demand model, the provider gives customers network-based access to a single copy of an application created specifically for SaaS distribution. Benefits of the SaaS model include:<ul><li>easier administration</li><li>automatic updates and patch management</li><li>compatibility: All users will have the same version of software.</li><li>easier collaboration, for the same reason</li><li>global accessibility</li></ul>The traditional model of software distribution, in which software is purchased for and installed on personal computers, is sometimes referred to as software as a product.",
        "PaaS":      "Platform as a Service|A cloud model in which providers deliver apps over the Internet and host users' hardware and software on their infrastructure. In a PaaS model, a cloud provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to its users as a service. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. PaaS does not typically replace a business' entire infrastructure. Instead, a business relies on PaaS providers for key services, such as Java development or application hosting. For example, deploying a typical business tool locally might require an IT team to buy and install hardware, operating systems, middleware (such as databases, Web servers and so on) the actual application, define user access or security, and then add the application to existing systems management or application performance monitoring (APM) tools. IT teams must then maintain all of these resources over time. A PaaS provider, however, supports all the underlying computing and software; users only need to log in and start using the platform – usually through a Web browser interface.<br>Most PaaS platforms are geared toward software development, and they offer developers several advantages. For example, PaaS allows developers to frequently change or upgrade operating system features. It also helps development teams collaborate on projects.",

M2M is a broad term as it does not pinpoint specific wireless or wired networking, information and communications technology. This broad term is particularly used by business executives. M2M is considered an integral part of the Internet of Things (IoT) and brings several benefits to industry and business in general as it has a wide range of applications such as industrial automation, logistics, Smart Grid, Smart Cities, health, defense etc. mostly for monitoring but also for control purposes.<br>In order to support the rapid new development and the worldwide adoption of the Internet of Things as well as the continued growth of M2M technology and its large scale applications in the future, a global adoption and deployment of the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) are required because all of the sensors and machine-readable identifiers needed to make the Internet of Things a reality will need an extremely large address space. Even if the current supply of IPv4 addresses were not to be exhausted soon, the size of IPv4 itself is not large enough to support the future requirement of IoT.<br>Consequently, the future success of M2M, as an integral part of the IoT, will largely be determined by the successful global adoption of IPv6.<br>M2M can include the case of industrial instrumentation - comprising a device (such as a sensor or meter) to capture an event (such as temperature, inventory level, etc.) that is relayed through a network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to an application (software program) that translates the captured event into meaningful information (for example, items need to be restocked). Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.<br>However, modern M2M communication has expanded beyond a one-to-one connection and changed into a system of networks that transmits data to personal appliances. The expansion of IP networks across the world has made it far easier for M2M communication to take place and has lessened the amount of power and time necessary for information to be communicated between machines. These networks also allow an array of new business opportunities and connections between consumers and producers in terms of the products being sold.",

Compared to cloud computing, fog computing emphasizes proximity to end-users and client objectives, dense geographical distribution and local resource pooling, latency reduction for quality of service (QoS) and edge analytics/stream mining, resulting in superior user-experience and redundancy in case of failure.<br>Fog Networking supports the Internet of Everything (IoE), in which most of the devices that we use on a daily basis will be connected to each other. Examples include our phones, wearable health monitoring devices, connected vehicle and augmented reality using devices such as the Google Glass.",

        "Sandbox":   "Sandbox|A sandbox is a testing environment that isolates untested code changes and outright experimentation from the production environment or repository, in the context of software development including Web development and revision control. Sandboxing protects \"live\" servers and their data, vetted source code distributions, and other collections of code, data and/or content, proprietary or public, from changes that could be damaging (regardless of the intent of the author of those changes) to a mission-critical system or which could simply be difficult to revert. Sandboxes replicate at least the minimal functionality needed to accurately test the programs or other code under development (e.g. usage of the same environment variables as, or access to an identical database to that used by, the stable prior implementation intended to be modified; there are many other possibilities, as the specific functionality needs vary widely with the nature of the code and the application[s] for which it is intended.<br>The concept of the sandbox (sometimes also called a working directory, a test server or development server) is typically built into revision control software such as CVS and Subversion (SVN), in which developers \"check out\" a copy of the source code tree, or a branch thereof, to examine and work on. Only after the developer has (hopefully) fully tested the code changes in their own sandbox should the changes be checked back into and merged with the repository and thereby made available to other developers or end users of the software.<br>By further analogy, the term \"sandbox\" can also be applied in computing and networking to other temporary or indefinite isolation areas, such as security sandboxes and search engine sandboxes (both of which have highly specific meanings), that prevent incoming data from affecting a \"live\" system (or aspects thereof) unless/until defined requirements or criteria have been met.",
