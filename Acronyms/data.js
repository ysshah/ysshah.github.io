For a specific case, see default gateway.</li></ul>Gateways, also called protocol converters, can operate at any network layer. The activities of a gateway are more complex than that of the router or switch as it communicates using more than one protocol.<br>Both the computers of Internet users and the computers that serve pages to users are host nodes, while the nodes that connect the networks in between are gateways. For example, the computers that control traffic between company networks or the computers used by internet service providers (ISPs) to connect users to the internet are gateway nodes.<br>In the network for an enterprise, a computer server acting as a gateway node is often also acting as a proxy server and a firewall server. A gateway is often associated with both a router, which knows where to direct a given packet of data that arrives at the gateway, and a switch, which furnishes the actual path in and out of the gateway for a given packet.<br>On an IP network, clients should automatically send IP packets with a destination outside a given subnet mask to a network gateway. A subnet mask defines the IP range of a private network. For example, if a private network has a base IP address of 192.168.0.0 and has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, then any data going to an IP address outside of 192.168.0.X will be sent to that network's gateway.

In a PaaS model, a cloud provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to its users as a service. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. PaaS does not typically replace a business' entire infrastructure. Instead, a business relies on PaaS providers for key services, such as Java development or application hosting. For example, deploying a typical business tool locally might require an IT team to buy and install hardware, operating systems, middleware (such as databases, Web servers and so on) the actual application, define user access or security, and then add the application to existing systems management or application performance monitoring (APM) tools. IT teams must then maintain all of these resources over time. A PaaS provider, however, supports all the underlying computing and software; users only need to log in and start using the platform – usually through a Web browser interface.<br>Most PaaS platforms are geared toward software development, and they offer developers several advantages.

Even if the current supply of IPv4 addresses were not to be exhausted soon, the size of IPv4 itself is not large enough to support the future requirement of IoT.<br>Consequently, the future success of M2M, as an integral part of the IoT, will largely be determined by the successful global adoption of IPv6.<br>M2M can include the case of industrial instrumentation - comprising a device (such as a sensor or meter) to capture an event (such as temperature, inventory level, etc.) that is relayed through a network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to an application (software program) that translates the captured event into meaningful information (for example, items need to be restocked). Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.<br>However, modern M2M communication has expanded beyond a one-to-one connection and changed into a system of networks that transmits data to personal appliances. The expansion of IP networks across the world has made it far easier for M2M communication to take place and has lessened the amount of power and time necessary for information to be communicated between machines. These networks also allow an array of new business opportunities and connections between consumers and producers in terms of the products being sold.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_to_machine|Wiki",

For example, on the data plane, fog computing enables computing services reside at the edge of the network as opposed to servers in a data-center. Compared to cloud computing, fog computing emphasizes proximity to end-users and client objectives, dense geographical distribution and local resource pooling, latency reduction for quality of service (QoS) and edge analytics/stream mining, resulting in superior user-experience and redundancy in case of failure.<br>Fog Networking supports the Internet of Everything (<div class='inlink'>IoE</div>), in which most of the devices that we use on a daily basis will be connected to each other.

    "CI":        "Continuous Integration|The practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies with a shared mainline several times a day. It was adopted as part of extreme programming (XP), which did advocate integrating more than once per day, perhaps as many as tens of times per day. The main aim of CI is to prevent integration problems, referred to as \"integration hell\" in early descriptions of XP. CI isn't universally accepted as an improvement over frequent integration, so it is important to distinguish between the two as there is disagreement about the virtues of each.<br>In addition to automated unit tests, organisations using CI typically use a build server to implement <i>continuous</i> processes of applying quality control in general — small pieces of effort, applied frequently. In addition to running the unit and integration tests, such processes run additional static and dynamic tests, measure and profile performance, extract and format documentation from the source code and facilitate manual QA processes. This continuous application of quality control aims to improve the quality of software, and to reduce the time taken to deliver it, by replacing the traditional practice of applying quality control after completing all development. This is very similar to the original idea of integrating more frequently to make integration easier, only applied to QA processes.<br>In the same vein, the practice of continuous delivery further extends CI by making sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users and makes the actual deployment process very rapid.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration|Wiki",
    "CD":        "Continuous Delivery|Also called Continuous Deployment. Continuous Delivery is a software engineering approach in which teams keep producing valuable software in short cycles and ensure that the software can be reliably released at any time. It is used in software development to automate and improve the process of software delivery. Techniques such as automated testing and continuous integration (<div class='inlink'>CI</div>) allow software to be developed to a high standard and easily packaged and deployed to test environments, resulting in the ability to rapidly, reliably and repeatedly push out enhancements and bug fixes to customers at low risk and with minimal manual overhead. CD builds on CI by adding the regular deployments to production as part of the process, however CD is not a requirement of CI. The technique (CD) was one of the assumptions of extreme programming but at an enterprise level has developed into a discipline of its own, with job descriptions for roles such as \"buildmaster\" calling for CD skills as mandatory.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery|Wiki",
    "OEM":       "Original Equipment Manufacturer|Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is a term used when one company makes a part or subsystem that is used in another company's end product. The term is used in several ways, each of which is clear within a context. The term sometimes refers to a part or subassembly maker, sometimes to a final assembly maker, and sometimes to a mental category comprising those two in contrast to all other third-party makers of parts or subassemblies from the aftermarket.<br>In the first usage, the OEM is the company that makes a part that is marketed by another company, typically as a component of the second company's own product. For example, if Acme Manufacturing Co. makes power cords that are used on IBM computers, Acme is regarded as the OEM of the power cords.<br>In the second usage, OEM refers to companies like value-added resellers, which are the second manufacturer in the definition above. If, for example, Hewlett-Packard sells circuit boards to Acme Systems for use in Acme's security systems, HP refers to Acme as an OEM.<br>In the third usage, OEM is a mental category for all of the makers involved when a final assembly was first built (originally equipped)—in contrast to whoever made aftermarket parts that were installed later. For example, if Ford used Autolite spark plugs, Exide batteries, Bosch fuel injectors, and Ford's own engine blocks and heads when building a car, then car restorers and collectors consider all of those brands as OEM brands, in contrast to aftermarket brands (such as Champion plugs, DieHard batteries, Kinsler fuel injectors, and BMP engine blocks and heads).
